# Colectica Repository API Examples

These samples show HTTP requests to the Colectica Repository API.

The requests in the `.http` files can be executed with the [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension for Visual Studio Code.
The `.md` files show the requests and responses together.

The examples use tokens surrounded by double braces. These need to be replaced with the appropriate values for your environment. For example, `{{token}}` should be replaced with a valid API token.
